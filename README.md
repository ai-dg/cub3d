## ▌ Key Features
▸ **Real-time 3D rendering with raycasting**  
▸ **Textured walls with directional shading** (North, South, East, West)  
▸ **Dynamic lighting effects for improved realism**  
▸ **Smooth player movement and rotation (WASD & arrow keys)**  
▸ **Collision detection to prevent walking through walls**  

## ▌ Result: **125% Score**
The project was successfully validated with a **125% score**, including all bonus features. 🎉

## ▌ Files
- `Includes/cube3d.h` → Contains function prototypes and required macros  
- `Srcs/cube3d.c` → Main game loop and rendering logic  
- `Makefile` → Automates compilation (`all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`)  

## ▌ **Gameplay & Mechanics**
1. The player starts in a **3D maze** with walls and open spaces.
2. The goal is to **explore the maze** and navigate using **raycasting-based rendering**.
3. The player can **rotate left/right** (arrow keys) and **move forward/backward** (WASD).
4. Walls are **textured and shaded** depending on their facing direction.
5. The **floor and ceiling** have configurable colors.

### ■ **Map Format (`.cub` files)**
A valid `.cub` map must:
- Be **surrounded by walls (`1`)**.
- Contain exactly one **player spawn point** (`N`, `S`, `E`, or `W`).
- Define **textures and colors** for walls, floor, and ceiling.

**Example map:**
